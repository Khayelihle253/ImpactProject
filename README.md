# Number_Summarizer Summarizes consecutive numbers into a range.

The logic of summarizing the numbers is on the class NumberRangeSummarizer. There is a helper method
in the class NumberRangeSummarizer called "checkInput" that should be private, since it's only task
is to provide the functionality on the "collect" method but made public for the sake of testing it
in the TestNumberSeparator Class. This class(TestNumberSeparator) is responsible for testing the methods 
of the NumberRangeSummarizer class and those tests are runned on the TestRunner class.
